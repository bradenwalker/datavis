# datavis
Data visualization project using d3

###Star Wars Data Visualizer

##Basic Functionality
This app displays data for different characters from the Star Wars universe. Users can click on characters' names to see a bar chart that shows various characteristics for that character, including their name, age, height, and other physical characteristics.

The data is displayed inside an SVG element. The data is bound to rect elements in the SVG using the d3 library (http://d3js.org). As users click on different character names, the graph goes through an animated transition to display the new data.

##Future Plans
The app will make requests to the Star Wars API (http://swapi.co) to access data. Requests will be configured using SWAPI-Wrapper (https://github.com/cfjedimaster/SWAPI-Wrapper).
